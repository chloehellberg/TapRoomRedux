## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description

This project utilizes React to create an imaginary tap room where a bar can store and track their kegs. Application allows a user to:
  - See full list/menu of all available kegs.
  - Submit a form to add a new keg to the list.
  - Ability to click on a keg to see its details.
    - For Each Keg: See its name, brand, price, quantity and style/type.
  - See how many pints are left in a keg (full keg has roughly 124 pints).
  - Ability to click a button on each keg to sell a pint of it and quantity of keg will descrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
  - Ability to "restock" keg once keg is empty and hits 0 pints.
  - Keg will update to say "Almost Empty" when it hits 10 pints left and "Out of Stock" when it hits 0 pints left.
